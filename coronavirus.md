# Coronavirus, its political economy, diagnosis and treatment

## Abstract

Science is part of a democratic culture that emanated mainly in Europe after the social democratic revolutions of UK and Europe in 16th century that was inspired by the Islamic revolution in Arabia, which created Hospitals and medical sciences. Arab science in turn benefitted from its interactions with scientific discoveries of India. So science is no parochial property of one nation or race. It is a global intellectual property of the entire world.

However, markets and its economies bring its own capitalist agenda, skewing the truth and scientific progress that has been achieved globally. With religious and fascist elements now on the ascendancy it is very important to bring certain aspects about Coronavirus, the disease, it's treatment etc., that needs to be discussed here.

## Introduction

First, there is lot of confusion between Cornonavirus and the disease that it causes. Just as in the case AIDS virus where the virus causes immunosupressant side-effects that require a remedial treatment, in the case of Coronavirus, one has to carefully distinguish between the medicines that prevent the multiplication of Coronavirus and the medicines that suppress its side-effects like the "cytokines storm". This awareness is lacking even among doctors and scientists. High quality scientific journals also have caused major damage to this process by allowing certain nationalistic and capitalist agendas to skew the outcome of the scientific process, causing enormous damage to science and scientific culture.

It has been demonstrated with sufficient scientific vigour that certain medicines like Hydrochloroquine (an anti-malaria drug) have Coronavirus preventive effects through invitro studies. French scientists have also demonstrated its effectiveness in human trials. Since Hydrochloroquine is a cheap medicine and the news of its effectiveness will cause damage to the share value of big pharma companies that have invested in vaccines, so there has been continuous barrage of media propaganda, including [fraudulent articles](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31180-6/fulltext) in reputed journals against Hydrochloroquine. Recently, some Bangladesh doctors have also found that Ivermectin in combination with Doxycycline has been quite effective in group of 50 patients with 100% success. This is now under further [randomised trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04407130). Like AIDS RNA-virus, it is quite possible that, instead of vaccines, this virus will be cured directly through the use of medicines rather than vaccines.

We have observed both through data available here and through data reported elsewhere that countries that have compulsory BCG injections have lower fatality rate than countries that do not have BCG vaccination programs. An illustrative example is Portugal (with BCG vaccination) and Spain (no BCG vaccination), with deaths in Spain being far higher than in Portugal. BCG vaccination program for people over 60 has also being trialled in India.

However, both these medicines and vaccines are first-line medicines in the prevention of Coronavirus, but they are little or no use in the treatment of Coronavirus-induced disease. The "cytokines storm" that the disease causes has many dangerous side-effects, such as clotting of the blood, damage to the brain, heart, causing a rise in blood pressure. These require very different line of treatment from the prevention of the virus. Unfortunately, this not very well understood and has lead to many deaths due to wrong diagnosis and approaches.

Many simple medicines like Paracetamol, blood thinners like Turmeric (curcumin) and palliative herbal medicines like Andrographis paniculata that prevent hyper immune reaction (cytokines storm) is [effective](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11101-011-9219-z) in these cases. Cuba has also been quite effective in developing Interferon drugs against many [diseases](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.20109199v1) and there has been some recognition of it's [effectiveness](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31042-4/fulltext) even in US academic community. 

## Coronavirus (Covid) data and it's correlations

Although [correlations](https://github.com/Sukii/Coronavirus-data/blob/master/covid-correlations.md) are not causal relations, they are data that are usefull to understand underlying structures of societies and biological systems. Here we consider correlation based on country-wise data on the following parameters:

1. CovidDeaths (per million population)

2. Over65percnt (% of people over age 65)

3. Hospital beds (per million)

4. GINI (index of inequality)

5. Obessity (% people with high BMI values)

6. Latitude from Equator (a measure of climate)

7. Blood group (A+/-, B+/-,O+/-,AB+/-)

8. BCG vaccination (Yes, Discontinued, No) for some limited set of countries

We calculated direct correlation between CovidDeaths vs every other parameter individually and also colectively together. We will explain how these can be understood alone and together. Other than these parameters we have also studied other irrelevant paramters as placebo effect, to determine base-line levels that can occur due to certain intrinsic randomness associated with such data.

## Price's law and biological evolution of disease

There are also biological [evolutionary](https://github.com/Sukii/Coronavirus-data/wiki) aspects of diseases that are inter-linked to human societies that need to be understood, especially in the case of coronavirus disease. Humbeen studied recentlyans were exposed to aplethora of new diseases 10,000 years back, at the dawn of agriculture and cattle rearing societies. Human-cattle interaction produced newer diseases like Smallpox that ravaged through many socities for centuries and was only controlled effectively through vaccination programs in 1960s. However, unlike DNA viruses that have stable strctures which are amenable fixed vaccines, Coronavirus belongs to a group of common cold RNA-viruss that are not stable and so difficult to target. Unlike the strcuture of DNA, the structure of RNA has been studied comprehensively only very recetly by [Venkatraman Ramakrishnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venki_Ramakrishnan).  

Despite media propoganada that it was created in a lab, it is clear that SARS-2 Cooronavirus is a further modification of SARS-1 that has been known to be transmitted from bats, pangolin or other such animals. The bats do not repond sevearly to these viruses and are known to have Interferon-like responses that keeps these viruses in check and their lack extereme reactions as in humans frees them from contracting covid-deisease. even in humans many individuals do nto respond severely to the disease and the reasons are not exactly known. It is also been noticed that certain blood groups are more susceptible to this diseases than others and the data also suggests that men (especially bald men) are more susceptible to this diseases than woman, which could be related to the [estrogen harmones](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04359329).

## Conclusion

In the era of fascism and nationalism with overtones of racism, doing science is like "Love in the time of Cholera". Despite this as middle-class wages it's war on Coronavirus (letting all the poor people to walk thousands of miles), this article is an attempt at fathoming the depths of the science behind Coronavirus and it's treatment.

This is just the beginning of the journey in the science of Coronavirus and despite many attempts to play-down the seriousness of this disease, like saying that this is just another flu, the serious nature of this disease and it's complicated scientific aspects will bring enormous strain on (in)human capitalist societies. Of course, the bigger question that Coronavirus brings to surface is whether such skewed unscientific capitalist society should not be put to rest to be able to build a society that is capable of handling diseases such as the Coronavirus that can bring human species to the brink of extinction. Of course, this doesn't mention other environmental damages such as global warming and other such side-effects of capitalism, which may in the the long-term could be much more dangerous than any such disease such as Cononavirus disease.
