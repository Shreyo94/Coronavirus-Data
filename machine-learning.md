# Machine Learning Tutorial

This a small little tutorial on machine-learning.

Not much programming or mathematics skill is required, but some basics in mathematics and statistics would be handy.

Created a [ml-test.csv](https://github.com/Sukii/Coronavirus-data/blob/master/data/ml-test.csv) to just kick-it-off.

Please install [Weka](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/#windows_1) and download the [ml-test.csv](https://github.com/Sukii/Coronavirus-data/blob/master/data/ml-test.csv) file.

Soon will be uploading a video to show how machine learning works using [Weka](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/#windows_1).

If you are smart enough you can create your own CSV file using the [csv-generator.html](https://github.com/Sukii/Coronavirus-data/blob/master/src/csv-generator.html) + [calculator.js](https://github.com/Sukii/Coronavirus-data/blob/master/src/calculator.js).

Hope to setup an IO endpoint that you can use for creating your own CSV files.
