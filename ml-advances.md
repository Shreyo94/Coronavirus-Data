## A critique of free energy principle as being super-Darwinism
It has been claimed that the 
[Free energy principle](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20-%20a%20rough%20guide%20to%20the%20brain.pdf)
is a super principle that goes beyond the Drawinism and historical materialism. In fact, the minimization of free energy as a principle is as old as Lagrange and Hamilton and dates back to 17th and 18th century, a part of progressive social capitalist development. Jaynes in 1957 proposed some maximum entropy principles in physics that provides certain ways of data modellling that are also useful.

Instead of optimizing for goal as in reenforcement learning, optimizing free energy is another interesting approach, but to elevate it to a super principle is a bit immature. AI and machine learning modelling of data are only as good as data that they model. Abstract philosophical principles have to interact with reality of brain function and roles that have historical evolutionary principles that are based on Darwinism and historical materialism for them to be useful to society.

It is true that AI and machine learning are important intellectual developments in computer science, but data doesn't exist in the abstract theoretical space. They are the products of flesh and blood of material advancements of now abstractly termed IoTs (Internet of Things). Between the data and IoTs lies the flesh and blood of biological beings that exist in a socio-political environment struggling to overcome viruses such as Covid-19 and other capitalist creations. Just as abstract freedom only exists in the context and geopolitics of corporate system, abstract free energy also lives in the highly limited context of the matrix of international data corporations.
